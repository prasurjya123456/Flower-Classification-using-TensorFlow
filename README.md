# Flower-Classification-using-TensorFlow
This project focuses on image classification of flowers using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained to recognize and classify images into five flower categories: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip.

#The workflow includes:
Data preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and batching of images.
Model training: building and training a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on the flower dataset.
Model evaluation: testing the model on unseen images.
Prediction & visualization: using the trained model to predict flower types from test images and displaying results with their predicted labels.
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to computer vision tasks such as image recognition and classification.
