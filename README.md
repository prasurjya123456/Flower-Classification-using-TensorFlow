# 🌸 Flower Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates **image classification of flowers** using a deep learning model built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) can recognize and classify images into **five categories**:  
🌼 Daisy | 🌿 Dandelion | 🌹 Rose | 🌻 Sunflower | 🌷 Tulip

## ⚡ Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** 🖼️  
   - Resizing, normalization, and batching of flower images  

2. **Model Training** 🤖  
   - Building and training a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) on the flower dataset  

3. **Model Evaluation** 📊  
   - Testing performance on unseen images  

4. **Prediction & Visualization** 🎯  
   - Predicting flower types from test images and displaying results with labels
